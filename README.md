# Final-Python-Project

  For this project I made a calendar generator. Now this might be relatively easy to do however I thought it was pretty cool and I am still a beginner in python and did have to go to YouTube for some help. The reason I came to make this my final project was because I have been really using my calendar a lot lately for regular reminders and appointments and such. I started an internship recently and have had to use my calendar quite a lot to schedule appointments and know when and where I need to go for these appointments. So, the first thing that came to mind when thinking about the project was when was it due, I then looked at the calendar to see how much time I had to do it and boom!! That was my idea for the project. 

    At the start of the code you can see I used "import sys" which provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate different parts of the python environment. Then I defined the get_year class and entered some text for the user to input so we can get the correct calendar. Then called the get_starting_day class so I could determine what the first day of the year fell on so we could also get the correct calendar. In both of these codes we used the sys.ext function incorporating our standard python library. I also incorporated some code to calculate and make the right assessment if the year was a leap year. I inputted all the names of the months and then also put in correct order how many days were in each month.
